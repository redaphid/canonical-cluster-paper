Full stack research, design, and development of two major initiatives: An open source IoT platform ("Meshblu") and a customer-facing application that allows users to create flows between devices and services without writing code ("Octoblu Designer").


Meshblu is a platform that allows devices and services ("things") to communicate with each other by abstracting concepts into to common messaging, eventing, and configuration systems. Meshblu facilitates communications across an extremely broad array of protocols so that hobbyist microcontroller projects can communicate with enterprise systems, social media services, and everything in-between. In addition to the core platform, Meshblu also provides a number of connectors that allow users to easily create and manage devices and services ("things"), as well as a number of pre-built connectors to popular "things". Meshblu also enforced security and access control policies that allowed users to share devices and services with other users.

The public instance of the Meshblu platform processed over 4 million messages per hour.

Meshblu was acquired by Citrix, who then developed the commercial frontend "Octoblu".
Octoblu provided the front-end experience for users who would like to manage their "things" graphically, and - most importantly - hosted the "Octoblu Designer", a flow-based visual editor that allowed users to create flows to graphically represent communication between their "things", then deploy those flows to the Meshblu platform.

Flows run in the cloud, allowing execution of arbitrary flows created by users securely and efficently due to our massively parallelizable architecture. D

Full stack development of Meshblu, an internet of things platform, and development work on practical solutions based on that platform.

Meshblu can connect hundreds different of services, internet of things devices, and hobby projects to each by translating them to a common messaging system.

This system was acquired by Citrix, who then developed the commercial frontend "Octoblu" mentioned in the Citrix section. The public instance of the Meshblu platform processed over 4 million messages per hour.
