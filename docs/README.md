# Welcome to the amazing repository for Canonical's written interview!

You will find some crazy systems I made to answer the prompts in order to make writing them a little more fun. I know it's overkill, but I wanted to try out some new technologies, and this seemed like a good excuse to do so.

Were these the best technologies to writing a document? Definitely. This is the first time such software has been written.

The code is bad. But you can get some sense of my ability. And some of these technologies were new to me!

This repo is forked from my resume generating repo, which I will refrain from linking to in an effort to try to keep this this written portion anonymous.

## Tech Stack

### Preact
I didn't want a build step, so I could avoid webpack and it's associated complexity. Instead, I decided to try out [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), which is similar to React, but using pure javascript and can be imported via a cdn! It can also emulate React if you want to use a build step, but I don't know why you'd do that.

### YAML
I'm usually not a huge fan, but It's definitely nicer than writing JSON by hand.

### Styles
I wanted to try out grid, so I used [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for the layout. I also wanted to try out [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) for the colors, so I did that too.

I spent too much time learning about font weights, and using a color eyedropper to pick colors from websites I thought had a nice theme. I ended up using [mubasic](https://www.mubasic.com/) as an inspiration for some of the design choices.


## Be Impressed!

Well, that's about it for this project. I hope _somebody_ reads this someday, and gets something out of it! If you're already using Json Doc, this will (mostly) work for you!
