Hey, Canonical Team!

I am a Linux nerd that is currently writing this from an Ubuntu machine. (Well, technically it's Pop, but I hope I'll be forgiven for this heresy).

I am an experienced full-stack engineer with a passion for Unix-philosophy based minimal, clean software solutions.

I've worked extensively with authz/n stuff at Magic Leap and Citrix, and I think it would be fun to do things along those lines again!

For example, I had a cluster design for Magic Leap that used Open Policy Agent to do auth stuff, translating LDAP/AD/Keycloak permissions into the OPA data store, allowing end-users to write policies in a declarative language that could be used to control access to resources in the cluster. I've also been responsible for 4-way OAuth handshakes while working on the open-source IoT platform "Meshblu".

I'd love to work with Canonical in some respect. I actually filter YCombinator jobs with "Linux", because it returns results that better match my interest.

I hope I've made a compelling case for the value I could bring to your team, and I look forward to hearing from you!
