      - prompt: Describe your experience with authorization systems, specifically Open Policy Agent and OAuth.
        answer: |
          I have an extensive, varied experience when it comes to authorization and authentication systems.
          So much so that it is hard to decide where to start. I will give some brief bullet points of my experiences over time with various authorization systems, and then I will give some more detailed examples of my experience with Open Policy Agent and OAuth.

          * The earliest "exotic" auth system I encountered in my career was a strange one called [OACC](http://oaccframework.org). It is a strange open-source system created by a colleague, and I remember it to be something like RBAC, with some permission delegation mechanism.

          * Next, I encountered SAML for use in federated identity management for higher education.

          * After this, I began work on the open-source Internet of Things platform "Meshblu", which was later acquired by Citrix.

          #### Meshblu
          Meshblu is capable of configuring and messaging hardware or software "devices" hardware being things like hue bulbs, or DIY Arduino projects, and software being things like web applications. I inherited Meshblu with a permission system that was baked directly in to the json document that represented the configuration of the device.

    I am impressed by the context you have provided me during this process.
    I know some people think it's a bad thing to do this kind of work up front - and I've heard muttering on Reddit, etc that these first set of questions are unreasonable - but contextualizing them as a quasi-first-interview makes it seem totally reasonable. In addition, I am equally impressed by the role you play when it comes to finding the right fit for applicants, even if they have applied to the wrong position. I wish other hiring processes were more like this. Anyway, just wanted to let y'all know those thoughts crossed my mind.
