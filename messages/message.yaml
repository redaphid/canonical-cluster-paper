    I am impressed by the context you have provided me during this process.
    I know some people think it's a bad thing to do this kind of work up front - and I've heard muttering on Reddit, etc that these first set of questions are unreasonable - but contextualizing them as a quasi-first-interview makes it seem totally reasonable. In addition, I am equally impressed by the role you play when it comes to finding the right fit for applicants, even if they have applied to the wrong position. I wish other hiring processes were more like this. Anyway, just wanted to let y'all know those thoughts crossed my mind.
